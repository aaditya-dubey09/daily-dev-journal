# 🧮 Array Cardio — Day 4 of 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to **Day 4** of my self-paced **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**! 🚀  
In this challenge, I explored powerful **JavaScript array methods** like `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `reduce()` — all through practical examples.  
There’s no visual UI for this one — it's all about mastering the logic in the **JavaScript Console**.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔎 Filtering arrays based on conditions
- 🧭 Mapping arrays into new structures
- 📊 Sorting data dynamically (ascending/descending)
- 🧮 Reducing arrays into single values
- ✅ Clean and reusable functional programming patterns

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
Array-Cardio-1/
├── README.md # Project description
├── index.html # Simple HTML wth JavaScript with array method challenges
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Minimal structure, mostly for message
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — Focused on `array.prototype` methods like:
  - `filter()`
  - `map()`
  - `sort()`
  - `reduce()`

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- Difference between `map` and `forEach`
- How `reduce()` simplifies calculations (e.g., totals, counts)
- Writing clean `sort()` functions
- Composing multiple array methods for powerful logic chains
- Debugging and exploring data in the console effectively

## 🎯 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Open the Developer Console (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`)
4. See all logic and outputs directly inside the console
5. Tweak the array data or logic inside `script.js` to practice further
