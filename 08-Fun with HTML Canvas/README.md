# 🎨 HTML5 Canvas Rainbow Drawing — Day 8 of 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to **Day 8** of my self-paced **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**! 🚀  
This day was all about experimenting with the **HTML5 Canvas API** — I created a vibrant **rainbow brush drawing experience** using dynamic stroke styles, line widths, and mouse events.

Draw anywhere on the screen and watch a rainbow trail follow your cursor! 🌈
