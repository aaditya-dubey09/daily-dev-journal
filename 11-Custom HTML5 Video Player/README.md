# 📽️ Custom HTML5 Video Player — Day 11 of 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to **Day 11** of my self-paced **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**! 🚀  
In this project, I built a fully custom **HTML5 video player** using only **Vanilla JavaScript** and **HTML/CSS**. This player includes playback controls, skip buttons, volume/speed sliders, a draggable progress bar, and even a fullscreen toggle.

- ⏩ Skip ahead or back using custom skip buttons
- 🎚️ Adjust volume and playback speed via sliders
- 📈 Visual progress bar with click and drag support

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — `<video>` tag with custom layout
- **CSS3** — Flexbox layout, transitions, styling for controls
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — Full control logic (event handling, syncing UI, fullscreen API)

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- Interacting with video API via `.play()`, `.pause()`, `.volume`, `.playbackRate`
- Building a custom progress bar and syncing it with video time
- Listening to and handling events like `timeupdate`, `click`, `mousemove`
- Toggling fullscreen with `requestFullscreen()` and `exitFullscreen()`
- Managing drag interactions for precise UI control (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`)

## 🎯 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. Load your own video file (replace the `src` in `<video>` tag if needed)
4. Use all the custom controls to interact with the player:
   - Play/Pause by clicking the video or the button
   - Adjust volume and speed with sliders
   - Click or drag progress bar to seek
   - Use fullscreen button to toggle full view
