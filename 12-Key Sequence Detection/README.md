# ⌨️ Key Sequence Detection — Day 12 of 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to **Day 12** of my self-paced **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**! 🚀  
In this challenge, I learned how to **detect a secret key sequence** typed by the user using **JavaScript keyboard events**. When the correct sequence is typed, a fun easter egg (🦄 via [Cornify](https://www.cornify.com/)) is triggered!

## 🌟 Features

- 👨‍💻 Listens to all key presses via `keyup` event
- 📜 Stores the latest keys pressed in order
- 🔐 Detects a **secret code** (in this case: `aaditya`)
- 🦄 Triggers a fun surprise using the [Cornify](https://www.cornify.com/) library when the code is matched
