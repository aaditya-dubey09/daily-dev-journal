# 📦 Local Storage Tapas Tracker — Day 15 of 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to **Day 15** of my self-paced **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**! 🚀  
In this project, I created a fun and interactive tapas tracker that utilizes **localStorage** to persist the user’s to-do list (or "plates") in the browser. The items remain saved even after the page is refreshed or reopened later.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Semantic elements and forms
- **CSS3** — Visual styling, typography, responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6)**:
  - `localStorage.getItem()` / `.setItem()` / `.removeItem()`
  - DOM querying and manipulation
  - Form handling with `.addEventListener()`
  - `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` for data handling

## 💡 What I Learned

- ✅ How to build a fully **persistent interactive list** using `localStorage`
- 🔁 How to **update the DOM dynamically** based on form input and user actions
- 🧠 Difference between directly modifying an array and updating `localStorage`
- 🧹 Importance of form resetting, data serialization, and data rehydration
- 🛑 How to handle empty states gracefully (like showing “Loading Tapas…”)

## 🎯 How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
2. Add an item using the input form (e.g., “🍤 Garlic Prawns”)
3. Check or uncheck items to mark them as complete
4. Use the action buttons to:
   - ✅ Check all items
   - ❌ Uncheck all items
   - 🗑️ Delete the list from localStorage
5. Refresh the page — your data persists!
