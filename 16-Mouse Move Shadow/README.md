# 🌈 Mouse Shadow Effect — Day 16 of 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to **Day 16** of my self-paced **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**! 🚀  
Today’s project was a colorful and interactive experiment using **mouse movement** to create a **dynamic, multicolored shadow effect** on a text element. As the mouse moves across the screen, the shadow follows, creating a playful glowing effect.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎯 Real-time interaction based on mouse position
- 🌈 Multidirectional, multicolored dynamic `text-shadow`
- ✨ Editable heading using `contenteditable` attribute
- 🎨 Smooth, animated visual delight on mouse hover

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Basic page structure and editable heading
- **CSS3** — Styling and base shadow setup
- **JavaScript (ES6)**:
  - `mousemove` event listener
  - Destructuring `offsetX` and `offsetY`
  - Dynamic `text-shadow` manipulation based on cursor position

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to track mouse coordinates relative to an element
- How to use destructuring to simplify DOM property access
- How to apply **multiple layered shadows** to text dynamically
- Managing interactivity with visual feedback
- Using `contenteditable` to allow user-modifiable text content

## 🎯 How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
2. Move your mouse around the screen
3. Watch the text shadow animate in real-time based on your cursor's position
4. (Optional) Click on the “🔥WOAH!” text to edit it yourself!
