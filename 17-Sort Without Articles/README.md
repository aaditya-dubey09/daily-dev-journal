# 🎸 Sort Without Articles — Day 17 of 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to **Day 17** of my self-paced **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**! 🚀  
Today’s project focused on **sorting a list of band names alphabetically**, **ignoring articles** like _“A”_, _“An”_, and _“The”_. This is a common problem in organizing data like music libraries or movie titles, and I learned how to implement it cleanly using JavaScript string manipulation and regular expressions.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔠 Sorts band names **alphabetically without being affected by leading articles**
- ✂️ Uses regex to filter out titles starting with "A", "An", or "The"
- 🎨 Clean and responsive layout with a background image
- ⚡ Dynamically generates and displays the sorted list

## 📂 Folder Structure
```
17-Sort Without Articles/
├── README.md # Project description
├── index.html # HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Basic structure and unordered list
- **CSS3** — Styling with background image and UI improvements
- **JavaScript (ES6)**:
  - `Array.prototype.filter()` and `sort()` for sorting logic
  - Regular expressions to match and ignore leading articles
  - DOM manipulation using `createElement()` and `appendChild()`

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to **ignore leading articles** in strings for sorting purposes
- Using **regular expressions** to match common prefixes in strings
- How to use `filter()` and `sort()` together for refined sorting
- How to dynamically **create and append list elements** in the DOM
- Clean separation of logic and UI in small interactive web apps

---

## 🎯 How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser
2. The list of bands will be displayed, sorted alphabetically
3. Band names that **start with "A", "An", or "The"** will be sorted by the rest of the title (e.g., “The Plot in You” will be sorted under “P”)
