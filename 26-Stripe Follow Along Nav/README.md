# 🎯 Animated Dropdown Nav — Day 26 of 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to **Day 26** of my 30-Day JavaScript journey!  
Today’s project is a visually impressive **animated dropdown navigation** menu with background morphing and arrow indicators.

## 💡 Features

- 🧠 Uses `getBoundingClientRect()` to align dropdown background to hovered menu item
- ✅ Responsive and minimal styling using only one HTML file

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to use `getBoundingClientRect()` to get element positions relative to the viewport
- Dynamically animate background size and position with `transform` and `setProperty`
- Efficient class toggling using `setTimeout()` and conditional logic
- How `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events differ from `mouseover` and `mouseout`

---

## 📦 Key Concepts Used

- `element.getBoundingClientRect()` for precision alignment
- `transform: translate()` for dynamic movement
- CSS transition effects for smooth dropdown appearance
- Event handling with `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`

---

## 🔥 Bonus Styling

- 🎨 Gradient background using layered linear gradients
- 🟡 Hovered menu items turn yellow for visibility
- 🧭 Dropdown background has drop shadows for elevation
- 🔽 Arrow indicator created via CSS `transform: rotate(45deg)`

## 🧪 Try This Out

1. Hover over **"Courses"** or **"Other Links"**
2. Watch the dropdown background adjust its size and position dynamically
3. Observe how the dropdown appears smoothly only after a short delay
