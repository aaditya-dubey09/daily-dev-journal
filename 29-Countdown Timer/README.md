# ⏱️ Day 29/30 - Countdown Timer App

Welcome to **Day 29** of my 30-Day JavaScript Challenge!  
Today’s project was a **Countdown Timer App** — a practical utility that lets users start a countdown with preset buttons or custom input, while displaying the remaining time and the exact return time.

### 🌟 Features

- Countdown timer that updates the page title, display in real-time and trigger the beep.
- Buttons with preset times (`20s`, `10min`, etc.) to quickly start a countdown.
- A form to input a **custom time** (in minutes).
- Displays the **end time** (e.g., *Be Back At 4:30*) based on system time.
- Prevents multiple timers from overlapping by clearing any running intervals.

### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to work with **`setInterval()`** and **`clearInterval()`** to manage timers precisely.
- Manipulating **Date** objects to calculate future timestamps.
- Updating the **document title** dynamically using JavaScript.
- Parsing and validating user input from a form.
- Adding event listeners to both buttons and forms for seamless UX.

### 🧪 How It Works

1. Click a button or enter a custom number of minutes and hit start.  

2. Timer begins counting down second by second, updating the display and tab title.  

3. The app calculates and shows the exact time when the countdown will finish.  

4. Once the countdown reaches zero, it clears the interval to stop the timer.
