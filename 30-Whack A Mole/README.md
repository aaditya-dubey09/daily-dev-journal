### 🧠 What I Learned

- **Object-Oriented Programming** in JavaScript with ES6 classes and proper encapsulation
- **Advanced CSS Animations** including keyframes, transforms, and cubic-bezier timing functions
- **Local Storage Management** for persistent high score tracking across sessions
- **Game State Management** with proper timer handling and event coordination
- **Modern Web APIs** including Vibration API for mobile haptic feedback
- **Performance Optimization** for smooth 60fps animations and efficient DOM manipulation

### 🧪 How It Works

1. **Select Difficulty**: Choose from 4 difficulty levels that affect mole appearance timing and game duration
2. **Start Playing**: Click "Start Game" to begin - moles will randomly appear in holes
3. **Whack Moles**: Click on moles as they pop up to score points (+10 per hit)
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor your score, accuracy, time remaining, and high score in real-time
5. **Game Over**: View final statistics and play again to beat your high score

### 🎮 Game Mechanics

- **Easy Mode**: 800-2000ms mole timing, 45 seconds game time
- **Normal Mode**: 500-1500ms mole timing, 30 seconds game time  
- **Hard Mode**: 300-1000ms mole timing, 25 seconds game time
- **Insane Mode**: 200-700ms mole timing, 20 seconds game time
