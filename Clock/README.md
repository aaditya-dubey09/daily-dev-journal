# 🕔 Clock — Day 2 of 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to **Day 2** of my self-paced **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**! 🚀  
This project is a custom **Analog Clock** built using **HTML, CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It reflects the real-time system clock and showcases clean transitions and visual feedback using pure frontend code.
